# Basic R workshop - README

Welcome! Here are some instructions to get ready for the basic R workshop at the MPI.

## Downloading R and RStudio

Different R versions can be downloaded from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network website](https://cran.r-project.org/). RStudio can be downloaded from its [website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). In both cases, choose the latest version available for your operating system.

The download and installation should be pretty straight-forward, if you have trouble check this [link](https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/). If you still have troubles, don't worry, we'll help you before the workshop.
