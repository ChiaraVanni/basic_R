# Why R?

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))

Some pros...

* R is free
* R has a great help system
* R is multi-platform (Windows, GNU-Linux, MacOSX)
* R has a lot of pre-installed statistical functions
* The user can create and apply their own functions in R

Some cons - and our reply to them!

* R has a limited graphical interface - but only when used in the command line!
* It doesn't have commercial support for users - but we can check forums such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)!
* It uses programming language and one has to learn the syntax - but we're here to show you the basics!

# Downloading R and RStudio

R versions can be downloaded from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network website](https://cran.r-project.org/). RStudio can be downloaded from the [website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).


# RStudio interface

1. Script window
2. Console
3. Environment. Where data objects/R objects are stored
4. Plot/Help/etc window

# Introduction to R programming language
## Intro

When writing R code, using hashtags (#) to include comments is highly recommended to make the notes understandable. Example:

```{r}
print("Hello") # This command prints an initial greeting :)
```

## How to get help

 `?` to read the help page of functions or data sets. For example:

`?R.version`

or 

`help(R.Version)`

The [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are a great resource.

Also check [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) frequently :)

## Object names

To assign an object to a name we use `<-` (equivalent to `=`). The typing shortcut is `Cntr` + `-`. Names...

* ... are case sensitive
* ... can contain letters, numbers, "." and "_". They should start with a letter.
* ... should not have function or operator names: `function`, `if`, `c`...

Example:

```{r}
Greeting <- print("Hello")
Greeting
```

## Data objects

There are the following types of objects:

* **Vectors**
* **Factors**. For qualitative data.
* **Lists**. Can contain vectors of different types (integer, double, boolean...).
* **Arrays**. Vectors organised by rows and columns.
* **Data frames**. Like an array but can contain columns of different types. The columns are called *variables*. A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R.

Some examples:

```{r}
# Vectors
x <- c(8,2,5,6,7)
y <- c(34,23,67,65,23)
z <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Factors
a <- factor(c(1,2,3,4,5))
b <- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))

# Lists
l <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9))
l
# The elements in a list can be named:
l_named <- list(int = 1:3, char = "a", bool = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), dbl = c(2.3, 5.9))
l_named

# Array
num.data <- array(c(x, y, z), dim=c(5,3))
num.data # Note that the logical vector is turned into a vector of 0 and 1.
# You can also transpose an array:
num.data.t <- t(num.data)
num.data.t

# Data frame
my.data <- data.frame(num.data, row.names = b)
my.data
# You can also create your data frame in a more organised way:
my.data.org <- data.frame(x, y, z, row.names = b)
my.data.org
```

## Attributes of the objects and their functions

* Attributes `attributes`
* Mode `mode`
* Type `typeof`
* Names `names`
* Dimensions `dim`. Only in two-dimensional data.
* Names of the dimensions `dimnames`
* Class `class`

Check what are the attributes of the objects created before. For example:

```{r}
dim(x)
dim(my.data)
dimnames(my.data)
# etc
```

## Basic maths and statistics in R

* `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`
* `^` and `sqrt`
* `exp`, `log`, `log10`, `log2`, `logb(x, base)`
* `max`, `min`, `range`, `mean`, `median`, `var`, `sd`, `quantile`, `sum`...
* Logical operators: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==` (*equals*), `!=` (*not equal to*), `&&` (*and*), `||` (*or*).
* Logical clauses `if() {} else {}`.
* Set operations: `union(x, y)`, `intersect(x, y)`...

Examples:

```{r}
x^2
x+y
sum(x)
mean(x)
median(x)
var(x)

if(min(x)>1 && min(y)<10) {
  print("Yes")
} else {
  print("No")
}

if(min(x)>1 || min(y)<10) {
  print("Yes")
} else {
  print("No")
}
```

## Subsetting strings and arrays

With the function `c()` we can generate strings of values. With the coordinates (square brackets, `[` and `]`) we can select specific elements from **strings**. With the operator `$` we can access columns in a **data frame** by the variable name. For *lists* we can use the operators `[ ]`, that will return a list, or `[[ ]]` that will return the elements of the list

You can find some help on subsetting [here](http://www.statmethods.net/management/subset.html) and [here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html)

Examples:

```{r}
# Generate a vector of consecutive numbers:
g <- c(1:7)
g

# Generate vectors of repeated values:
h <- rep(4, 7)
h

# Select specific elements from a vector
x
x[2]
x[c(2,4)]
x[2:4]

# Select specific elements from a list
l
l[[3]]
l_named
l_named[[3]]
l_named$bool # If we give names to the items in a list, we can access them like this.

# Select specific elements from a matrix.
num.data
num.data[1, 1]
num.data[1:3, c(1,3)]
# This is useful to make subsets:
num.data.subset <- num.data[,1:2]
num.data.subset

# You can also select strings of letters
my.letters <- letters[1:6]
my.letters
# Also capital letters.
MY.LETTERS <- LETTERS[1:6]
MY.LETTERS

# Access the variables in a data frame.
my.data.org$x
my.data.org$y
```

### Generate random sequences

* Check `?sample`

```{r}
sample(10)
sample(10, 4)
sample(10, replace=TRUE)
sample(x, prob=(x/sum(x)))
```

* Random distributions. In general, `rDistribution` generates a random distribution with a given sample size (first argument) and given parameters.  Examples:
    * Normal distribution `rnorm`
    * Student $t$ distribution `rt`
    * Poisson distribution `rpois`
    * $\chi ^2$ distribution `rchisq`

To visualise it in a histogram:

```{r}
hist(rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)) # 100 samples of mean=0 and SD=1 from a normal distribution.
```

Use `dnorm` for density at a value, `pnorm` for distribution function and `qnorm` for quantile function. Same for other distributions. Check the help pages for these functions if you're interested.

## Dealing with NAs

Identifying and replacing non-available (NA) values in our datasets can be useful:

```{r}
v <- c(1, 5, 19, 2, 23, NA, 3, 9, NA)
v

is.na(v)
which(is.na(v))

# Create a vector without the NAs
w <- v[!is.na(v)]
w

# Substitute NAs for e.g. 0
v2 <- v
v2[is.na(v2)] <- 0
v2

# Inf (infinite) and NaN (not a number) are different from NA:
5/0
0/0
is.infinite(5/0)
is.nan(0/0)

# NAs can be removed in some functions
mean(v)
mean(v, na.rm=TRUE)
```

For linear models (`lm` function) one can use `na.omit` or `na.exclude`. 
## Ordering & sorting

The function `order` orders the items in a data frame. By default it does it in increasing order, but we can specify the opposite with the parameter `order(..., decreasing = TRUE)`. The output of the function is the *position* of the elements in the data frame, not their values.

```{r}
my.data
order(my.data) 
order(my.data, decreasing = TRUE)
```

`sort` is used to order the elements in a vector:

```{r}
v2
sort(v2) # Orders the elements in a vector
sort(my.letters, decreasing = T)
```

`sort` doesn't work for data frames, but works with vectors within a data frame (*i.e.*, variables):

```{r}
my.data
sort(my.data$X1)
```

# Upload and Exporting
## Importing data from Excel

To import a dataset from Excel the best is to save the Excel file as a comma-separated values (`.csv`) or a tab-separated values (`.tsv`) file.

The `.csv` and `.tsv` files can be imported from the tab "Environment" in RStudio:

![Click on `Import Dataset` --> `From text (base)...`.](Import.png)

Alternatively, you can use the following command:

```
# Make sure you're in the working directory where the file is:
R_workshop <- read.csv("R_workshop.csv", sep=";")
```

The package `readxl` is designed to deal with `.xlsx` files. One advantage is that it has functions that allow to read files with more than one spreadsheet.

# Installing Packages

A package is file containing some functions designed for a specific task(s). For example, `ggplot2` is very useful to create elegant plots and the package `vegan` is used for ecological analyses.

Which packages are currently loaded?

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

To install a package and to activate it in the current workspace we do:

```
# To install a package (this task can take a while and may ask for additional packages to be installed):
install.packages("ggplot2")

# To call the package and use its functions in the current session use:
library(ggplot2) # or:
require(ggplot2)
```

Using the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) software to install packages is highly recommended:

```
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")   # This command installs BiocManager if it is not already installed. 

BiocManager::install("ggplot2")

require(ggplot2)
```

# RStudio Projects

The objects created in a R session are shown in the tab "Environment". These objects will not be available if we close the R session unless we save the workspace (however you're always asked if you want to save the current workspace upon closing R or RStudio).

A good alternative to not deal with this issue is to create a R project. 

![1. Click on "Create a project".](Rproject.png)

![2. Associate your R project with a directory in your computer ("New Directory" or "Existing Directory"). Alternatively, you can download a repository from a version control platform like GitHub.](Rproject1.png)

![3. Choose a name for your directory. You can also turn the directory into a git repository.](Rproject2.png)

# R markdown and R notebooks

Check the [R markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for markdown help.

In this section, let's open the file `workshop_notebook.Rmd` in RStudio and check it in parallel to the `workshop_notebook.html` file. We have created a R notebook (written in R markdown) that can be "knitted" to generate the html document.

The elements of an R Markdown are:

* the header. This is where the title, author, date and output format is specified. Output format can be pdf, html, docx...
* the main text. It can include sections, bullet points, tables, etc. Sorry to repeat ourselves, but check the [R markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for more information :)
* code chunks. To insert an R code chunk type `Cntrl`+`Alt`+`I` or go to the `Inset` tab in the script window in RStudio. The chunks work like tiny R scripts and you can also include comments inside using hashtags (#). Apart from R code, you can include chunks for other coding languages.
